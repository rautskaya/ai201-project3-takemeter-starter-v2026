## What This Does

This classifier reads posts from r/fitbit, a public subreddit where people share Fitbit problems, buying advice, and opinions. It sorts each post into one of three labels: `analysis` (a claim backed by a specific, checkable fact), `request` (asking for help or advice), or `hot_take` (a confident opinion with no evidence behind it). In short, it distinguishes claims supported by evidence from posts that are simply questions or unsupported opinions.

---

## Label Taxonomy

### `analysis`

**Definition:** Makes a claim backed by a specific, checkable fact — a battery percentage, a step count, a named model/spec comparison, a screenshot of data.

**Example 1:**
> "Google health app and Charge 6 battery life" — battery went from 55% to 49% during a 24-minute drive, cutting battery life in half.

**Example 2:**
> "Lower Battery Life Since Google Health Switch" — Charge 6 now dies within 1-2 hours once it hits low battery, and only lasts a couple of days total, down from a full week before.

### `request`

**Definition:** Asking for specific help, troubleshooting, or buying advice — seeking information rather than asserting a claim.

**Example 1:**
> "Connecting Fitbit Aria 2026" — setup gets stuck right after connecting to Wi-Fi, ends with "Anyone got any ideas?"

**Example 2:**
> "Fitbit Air won't pair – 'PIN or pair code is incorrect'" — describes the exact error message and asks why it won't pair.

### `hot_take`

**Definition:** A confident claim about the product or brand with no supporting evidence offered.

**Example 1:**
> "Been using fitbit for 10 years RUINED" — calls the new app "absolutely terrible" and says "nothing about this update is good," with no specific data behind it.

**Example 2:**
> "Google always makes it worse" — "Why does everything Google touches turn to $hit? I despise this new app... We just want the numbers... It's now useless." Strong, emotional judgment with no specific data or checkable fact behind it.

### The hardest boundary

**Which two labels:** `analysis` vs. `hot_take`

**The decision rule I used every time:** If a strong opinion is backed by a specific, checkable fact or measurement, label it `analysis` — even if the tone is heated. Only use `hot_take` when the judgment is asserted with no supporting evidence at all.

This came from a genuinely ambiguous post: "New to Fitbit I can't believe how completely wrong the sleep tracker is" calls the tracker "completely and utterly useless" (sounds like a `hot_take`), but backs it up with a specific observation — checked their phone at 12:45 AM while Fitbit reported them asleep since 11 PM, and later showed them asleep while they'd actually been awake for over 1.5 hours. The heated language made it *feel* like `hot_take`, but the rule is about evidence, not tone — so this one is `analysis`.

## The Dataset

<!-- Where you collected from, how you labelled, your counts, and three hard
     cases. -->

**Where the posts came from:**

**How I labelled them:** <!-- Cold first? Pre-labelled with AI and corrected?
Say so plainly — the disclosure is required, not penalised. -->

**Counts per label:**

| Label | Count | Share |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
| **Total** |  | 100% |

**Three hard cases**

<!-- Any post that made you pause: what it was, which two labels it could have
     been, and what you chose. These are worth more than the easy 190. -->

**1.**
> *The post:*
>
> *Could have been:*
>
> *I chose, because:*

**2.**
> *The post:*
>
> *Could have been:*
>
> *I chose, because:*

**3.**
> *The post:*

> *Could have been:*
>
> *I chose, because:*

## The Training Run

<!-- Your starting model, your settings, and anything you changed and why. -->

**Base model:**

**Settings:** <!-- epochs, learning rate, batch size, seed -->

**Anything I changed from the defaults, and why:**

**Split sizes:** <!-- train / val / test, and per-label counts in the test
split. If a label had fewer than about 8 in test, say so — it explains a lot
of next unit's variance. -->



---

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments — what you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     ⚠️ Plus disclosure of any pre-labelling. If you had a model pre-label a
     batch and then read and corrected every one, say that. It's an allowed
     workflow and disclosing it costs you nothing. Not disclosing it is the
     problem. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

**Pre-labelling disclosure:**

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 6 — THE TEST ═══════════════════════

     Don't fill these in during unit 5.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

---

## Baseline vs. Trained

<!-- Both models on the same posts. `python baseline.py --trained results.json`
     prints this table for you. -->

| Measure | Baseline | Trained | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall accuracy |  |  |  |
| Macro F1 |  |  |  |
| F1 — `label_one` |  |  |  |
| F1 — `label_two` |  |  |  |

**What I predicted before I looked:**
<!-- Milestone 1 asks you to write this BEFORE seeing the trained numbers. A
     prediction made afterwards isn't one. -->

**What the gap actually means:**
<!-- If the baseline matched your trained model, your fine-tuning added
     nothing — and that is a real finding, not a failure. Say it plainly. -->



---

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria across three seeds. The notebook's section 6 prints the
     spread table; the Target and Verdict columns are yours. -->

| Criterion | Target | Seed 42 | Seed 7 | Seed 2024 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Confusion matrix

<!-- ⚠️ TYPED AS A MARKDOWN TABLE. The notebook prints one ready to paste.
     An image of a matrix earns nothing. -->

| true \ predicted |  |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|
| **** |  |  |  |
| **** |  |  |  |
| **** |  |  |  |

**My biggest off-diagonal number, and what it means:**
<!-- Not "the model made mistakes" — WHICH boundary it didn't learn, and which
     direction. "7 real analysis posts were called hot_take and only 3 went the
     other way" is a direction, not just an error rate. -->



---

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED against LAST UNIT's target. The target has to hold across
     all three seeds, not turn up sometimes. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

<!-- For each miss: the cause, and how you know. The four common causes are:
     too few examples for a label, a boundary you applied inconsistently, a
     genuinely hard label pair, and a task the model can't reach from this
     much data.

     ⚠️ Use your agreement report as evidence. It is the only instrument you
     have that can tell a LABELLING problem from a MODEL problem, and this
     section is graded on whether you used it that way. -->



---

## Agreement Report

<!-- Your rate against the staff set, and every disagreement adjudicated.

     Remember you labelled these 30 under the STAFF taxonomy in
     data/staff_taxonomy.md, not your own — so every argument below is made
     from those definitions and those decision rules. -->

**Agreement rate:** ___ / 30 = ___%

<!-- Nobody grades this number. A 60% who argues every disagreement from the
     stated rules beats a 95% who wrote "staff was right" nine times. Several
     of the 30 were chosen because they're genuinely ambiguous — you should be
     winning some of these. -->

**Disagreements**

<!-- Three lines each: the post, both labels, and who you think is right and
     why — grounded in the staff definitions you were both applying.

     Then sort each into one of three piles:
       (a) the rule covered it and I applied it loosely → a consistency problem
       (b) the rule genuinely doesn't say               → a gap in the definitions
       (c) the rule is ambiguous here and my reading is defensible → argue it.
           This is a legitimate win.

     Pile (a) is the one that matters most for your diagnosis: if you applied a
     written rule two different ways on 30 posts, that is direct evidence about
     what you did across your own 200. -->

**1.**
> *The post:*
>
> *Staff said / I said:*
>
> *My call, and why:*
>
> *Which pile:*

**2.**
> *The post:*
>
> *Staff said / I said:*
>
> *My call, and why:*
>
> *Which pile:*

**What the pattern in my disagreements tells me:**

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Which diagnosis pointed at it:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Seed 42 | Seed 7 | Seed 2024 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it didn't, say so. Relabelling that didn't help is a genuinely
     interesting result and earns full credit. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped. -->



**The gap between what I meant my labels to capture and what the model
learned:**
<!-- Two sentences. Your confusion matrix is the evidence. -->
